## Abstract
Users can access this flashcard exercise through the terminal on their local device. The card set includes 30 flashcards, each presenting a question and three possible answers. User chooses number 1, 2, or 3 to submit their guess (1 or 2 if true/false question). The game communicates whether an answer is correct or incorrect. At the end of play (once 30 cards are up), the user is provided with a game-over message along with their percentage of correct answers.

This project was completed using Test-Driven Development(TDD) via Chai assertion library and Mocha testing framework. <br>
JavaScript code was implemented following Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) paradigm.
